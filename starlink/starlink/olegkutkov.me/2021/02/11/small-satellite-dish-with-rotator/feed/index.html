					<description><![CDATA[A very interesting solution!  How accurate are these servos for positioning?

I solved the issue with mechanics in this way.
This is for small loads.

This is for heavier, horizontal mechanisms will have a common axis.

Found a horizontal mechanism with a full main gear, therefore it works 360 degrees.  This is not easy, almost all models are produced with a half wheel, with the ability to rotate 180 degrees.  Such models can be placed on horizontal rotation.]]></description>
