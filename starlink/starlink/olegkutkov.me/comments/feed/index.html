					<description><![CDATA[Hi, 

What PoE did you use and is the ethernet wiring still proprietary ? I have two different  320w Poe for the high performance starlinks with the funky ethernet adapter on 2 vehicles and wanted to test this one is using the PoE rather than plugging the new brick into the inverter 

Stay safe

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Oleg, I have been thinking about buying these STA8089, as I am having several problems. Not everyone can be resolved with a weld rework. Some solutions were solved by placing a patch antenna, directly in place of the micro antenna, just feeding it 3.3V and adding a small inductor, without using BIAS-T. This STA8089 is very expensive for Brazil. Is there any other model that works and is cheaper? Another question, when the STA8089 is off the board, in your APP I didn&#039;t see a place that shows whether the chip is communicating or not. I only see it when it tracks satellites.
Thank you for all the past knowledge!]]></description>

Where&#039;s the fun in that though!?But then.... You are right.... we end up, instead of actually applying the device to do its work...we have to work on the device ti even make it work. Some do say that the fun us in the journey.. how we got there.

I like projects like these though, it really shows how smart some are.... Heck if i could come up with anything like this off the cuff... i mean .. that&#039;s why i am here, and not the 1 who wrote the article.

Now, to explore more posts since I&#039;d just finished reading this 1 getting here from a google search. Curious of any further developments....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Oleg,

I have made the modification and it works nice. But I have one problem. When connecting the antenna through ETH cable to a companion computer (like RasPi), it seems that the antenna do not provide the internet to the companion computer but, when taking the ETH cable and connecting it to a laptop, it receives the internet connection. Then, when connecting back the ETH cable to the companion computer, it has internet connection. 

Do you know why this could happen? I know, in principle, that also connecting the antenna to a normal modem works fine also.]]></description>

No. It&#039;s too weak and doesn&#039;t have enough power and efficiency.]]></description>

Olá amigo, esse regulador de tensão também teria a mesma eficiencia?

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Oleg. I copied and pasted the unanswered questions from another commenter. 
Can you please tell me what temperature and flow I would need to set on my heat gun to remove the metal can in front of the GPS chip and what temperature and flow I would need to set, so I can rework the GPS chip also do I need to reattach the metal can afterward or is it not necessary?]]></description>
