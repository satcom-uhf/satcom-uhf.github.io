Where&#039;s the fun in that though!?But then.... You are right.... we end up, instead of actually applying the device to do its work...we have to work on the device ti even make it work. Some do say that the fun us in the journey.. how we got there.

I like projects like these though, it really shows how smart some are.... Heck if i could come up with anything like this off the cuff... i mean .. that&#039;s why i am here, and not the 1 who wrote the article.

Now, to explore more posts since I&#039;d just finished reading this 1 getting here from a google search. Curious of any further developments....]]></description>

Hi. 
I&#039;m stuck on the demodulation of the signals. This solution is great for the band overview and monitoring the presence of some radio signals. But I found that there are non-linearities and gain differences between my HackRF instances. This makes spectrum combining a complicated task.
Currently, I&#039;m working on another project but hope to return to this idea soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Oleg, this is a great idea.  Given this can be overcome with a SDR that can do a larger spread.  Have you made any more progress on this?]]></description>
