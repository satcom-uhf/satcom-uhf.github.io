					<description><![CDATA[https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/blog/dumping-and-extracting-the-spacex-starlink-user-terminal-firmware/

The ST security chip is also used in the dish. I wonder what did u dump from the chip? Is it public key only, or you can also dump some private key? The private key is probably used to authenticate the dishy when talking to satellite. So if u dump the private key, you will be able to create a fully customized client to poke the satellite, in theory.]]></description>
